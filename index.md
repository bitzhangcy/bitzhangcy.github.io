I am **Chunyang (Cedric) Zhang**, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the **University of New South Wales (UNSW)**, Canberra. Supervised by [Prof. Daoyi Dong](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Daoyi.Dong) and [Prof. Huadong Mo](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/huadong-mo), my research focuses on the intersection of **Generative Models** and **Modern Optimization**.

My goal is to leverage advanced deep learning (e.g., Diffusion Models, World Models) and control theory to enhance the robustness and deployment of complex systems in real-world scenarios.
