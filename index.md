# About Me

<img src="https://chunyangzhang.com/chunyangzhang.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Chunyang Zhang (Cedric, å¼ æ˜¥é˜³)**.

Chunyang Zhang is a first-year Ph.D. student specializing in **Computer Science** at the School of Engineering and Information Technology, University of New South Wales. He completed his Bachelor's degree in **Weapon Science and Technology** from Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2020. He further pursued his Master's degree in **Control Science and Engineering** from Beihang University, Beijing, China, graduating in 2023. Currently, I am conducting research on advanced machine learning techniques and modern optimization techniques under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Daoyi Dong](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/dong-dx) and [Dr. Huadong Mo](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/huadong-mo).
