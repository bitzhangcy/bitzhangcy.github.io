We live in a dynamic world where each second reveals fleeting or lasting landscapes. Photography captures the beauty of the present, offering delight to all. With a passion for photography, I capture fleeting moments using a **Xiaomi 14 Ultra**, but I aim to upgrade to **a professional camera** to enhance my skills.


## History

China's captivating millennia-spanning history deeply intrigues me. Exploring its historical narrative reveals how events echo throughout time, shaping diverse outcomes. Understanding different perspectives and interpretations based on unique environments and life experiences is also fascinating. I particularly research the **Five Dynasties**, **Ming Dynasty**, and **Late Qing Dynasty**.



## Reading
