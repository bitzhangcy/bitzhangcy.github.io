The gym provides a much-needed escape from my daily routine, offering some alone time and leaving me energized for the next day!

## Culinary arts

Confucius once remarked, "There is no limit to the pursuit of culinary finesse, be it in the refinement of grains or the delicate slicing of meat." Thus, for me, delving into the art of new recipes over the weekend is not merely a pastime, but a delightful indulgence.

We live in a dynamic world where each second reveals fleeting or lasting landscapes. Photography captures the beauty of the present, offering delight to all. With a passion for photography, I capture fleeting moments using a **Xiaomi 14 Ultra**, but I aim to upgrade to **a professional camera** to enhance my skills.



## Reading and History

Reading brings immense pleasure, offering engagement with the world and an escape from it. Non-fiction genres provide valuable insights for navigating life, while fiction serves as a refuge from reality. I'm passionate about **Chinese history** and **fiction**.

China's captivating millennia-spanning history deeply intrigues me. Exploring its historical narrative reveals how events echo throughout time, shaping diverse outcomes. Understanding different perspectives and interpretations based on unique environments and life experiences is also fascinating. I particularly research the **Five Dynasties**, **Ming Dynasty**, and **Late Qing Dynasty**.
